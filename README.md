## 🧑‍💻 About Me
Dynamic and results-oriented **DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect, and SRE** with 8+ years of experience designing, automating, and managing scalable infrastructures.  
I specialize in **cloud platforms, automation, CI/CD, and system reliability**, ensuring cost-efficient, secure, and highly available solutions.  

💡 As a DevOps engineer, I don’t usually create many public repositories here — most of my GitHub work is around **automation, pipelines, and infrastructure management** rather than building open-source apps.
