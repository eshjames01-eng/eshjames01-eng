# 👋 Hi, I'm Esh James

🚀 **Senior DevOps Engineer & Cloud Architect**  
💻 Passionate about building scalable, secure, and reliable cloud-native infrastructures.  
⚙️ Experienced in automation, CI/CD, container orchestration, cloud migrations, and system reliability.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
- 🔹 I design and implement **cloud architectures** with a focus on scalability and security.  
- 🔹 I work extensively with **AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions**.  
- 🔹 My expertise spans **infrastructure as code (IaC)**, **observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)**, and **site reliability engineering (SRE)** practices.  
- 🔹 I collaborate with cross-functional teams to **optimize CI/CD pipelines** and **reduce deployment friction**.  
- 🔹 I don’t usually create many public repositories here — as you know, **DevOps engineers often use GitHub more for automation, integration, and CI/CD pipelines** rather than hosting application code.
